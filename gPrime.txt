    when determining whether a number is prime is based
     on optimization. The key idea is that if a number
      num has a divisor larger than num / 2, it 
      would also have a corresponding divisor smaller than num / 2. 
      Therefore, checking up to num / 2 is sufficient to determine if 
      num is divisible by any smaller number other than 1 and itself.
    
    
    boolean isPrime = true;
        for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
